# Roadmap / Help Wanted

Origin is on a voyage, but not home yet. It works great for me (lol), but this is ship is moving fast and feedback/help would be appreciated! (I dont know what I'm doing hlep).

If you see weird CSS, strange layout behavior, or a suspiciously murky corner of
the codebase, you are probably right to stay away.

## High Priority

- SQUASH BUGS
- Fresh Docker install smoke tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows!!

- Integration audit: do integrations even work? Confirm what works, what needs setup docs, and what should be removed or hidden. 
- Self-host troubleshooting cookbook. Document the weird 30-second fixes that otherwise become 30-minute searches: Dovecot cleartext auth for local stacks, ntfy Android Instant Delivery for non-ntfy.sh servers, clipboard limits on plain-HTTP Tailscale URLs, Radicale collection URLs, and similar traps.
- Cookbook reliability on other computers. This is probably the area most likely to need work across different machines, GPUs, drivers, shells, and Python environments.
- Tile/window management correctness. I had to brute force my way a bit here, I'm aware, popups, dropdowns, and fixed-position UI inside transformed modals can land in the wrong place.
- Esc button, it's small but a lot of windows that arent still close on esc and alot of them doesnt. 
- Skill audit, how does your model respond to skill injection, does it follow? Does its parsing miss? 
- Better degraded-state reporting for ChromaDB, SearXNG, email, ntfy, and provider probes.
- Provider setup/probing audit for Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, xAI, OpenRouter, OpenAI, and DeepSeek.

## Refactor Targets
- CSS cleanup. `static/style.css` basically Calypso's island atm.
- Tour core helper. The onboarding tours have too much copy-pasted scaffolding; promote a shared `tour-core.js` helper before adding more tours.
- Mobile media override discoverability. A lot of "CSS did not move" bugs are mobile `@media` overrides of the same selector; comments or linting around desktop/mobile paired rules would help.
- Dead code pass for old routes, stale feature flags, and unused UI states.

## Frontend

- Mobile gallery/editor polish. Easier to launch/download inpaint model or any missing pieces.
- Accessibility pass: keyboard navigation, focus states, contrast, reduced motion.
- Improve empty states and error messages on fresh installs.
- Tighten first-run setup, hints, and tours so they do not repeat or fight each other.
- Vendor CDN assets eventually for a more fully self-hosted/offline mode.

## Backend

- More tests around endpoint probing and provider setup.
- Better task scheduler defaults and visibility.
- Backup/restore guide and helper flow for `data/`.
- Security hardening around admin-only tools and clear docs for their risk.

## Not The Focus Right Now

I prob shouldnt add more themes.
