# Security Policy

Origin is a self-hosted AI workspace with privileged local capabilities. Please do not run it as a public, unauthenticated service.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are handled on the default branch until formal releases are cut.

## Deployment Guidance

- Keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true`.
- Use HTTPS when exposing the app beyond localhost.
- Put the app behind a trusted reverse proxy or private network.
- Protect `.env`, `data/`, logs, uploaded files, generated media, and database files.
- Disable open signup unless you intentionally want new accounts.
- Keep demo/test users non-admin, and remove them entirely on serious deployments.
- Give admin accounts strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.
- Leave high-risk agent tools restricted to admins: shell, Python, file read/write, email send/read, MCP, app API, task/skill/memory management, settings, tokens, and model serving.
- Rotate API keys, webhook secrets, and Origin API tokens if they appear in logs, screenshots, demos, or shared chats.
- Treat shell, model-serving, MCP, email, calendar, and vault features as privileged admin functionality.

## Publishing A Fork

Before pushing a public fork, run:

```bash
git status --short
git check-ignore -v .env data/auth.json data/app.db logs/compound.log origin.db
git grep -n -I -E "(sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}|xox[baprs]-|AIza[0-9A-Za-z_-]{20,}|Bearer [A-Za-z0-9._~+/-]{20,})" -- . ':!static/lib/**' ':!package-lock.json'
```

Only `.env.example`, docs, source, tests, and static assets should be committed. Never commit live `data/` contents, local databases, uploaded files, generated media, logs, backups, API keys, password hashes, or personal documents.

## Reporting

Please report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub security advisories: https://github.com/satiricalguru/Origin/security/advisories
If the repository's private reporting is unavailable, email the maintainer directly (check recent commits for contact).

Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities. We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and triage within 5 business days.
